# Privacy Policy

## Pokémon Restock Monitor Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2/4/2026

Pokémon Restock Monitor is designed with privacy and minimal data handling as core principles. This Privacy Policy explains what data the app does and does not collect, how limited data is used, and the scope of the app’s operation.

---

## Overview

Pokémon Restock Monitor does **not** collect, store, sell, or process personal user data. The app operates solely to publish automated Pokémon TCG restock alerts to Reddit communities where it has been explicitly installed by moderators.

The app is informational, passive, and automation-focused.

---

## Data the App Does Not Collect

Pokémon Restock Monitor does **not** collect or process:

- Reddit user data (usernames, IDs, profiles, or activity)
- Discord user personal information
- IP addresses or device identifiers
- Browsing history or behavioral analytics
- Cookies or tracking identifiers
- Location data
- Messages, comments, or private communications
- Payment or financial information

The app does not perform analytics, advertising, profiling, or tracking of any kind.

---

## Limited Operational Data That Is Stored

To function correctly, Pokémon Restock Monitor stores a minimal amount of **non-personal, operational data**:

- The last processed Discord message ID per monitored channel  
  (used only to prevent duplicate posts)
- Subreddit-specific configuration values, such as:
  - Discord channel IDs
  - Boolean feature toggles
  - Optional allowlisted Discord author IDs

This data is stored using Reddit’s built-in Redis service and is scoped per subreddit.

No personal identity information is inferred, enriched, or retained.

---

## Data Sources

Pokémon Restock Monitor accesses:

- Publicly available Discord message data from channels explicitly configured by moderators
- Reddit APIs necessary to submit posts and retrieve app context

The app does **not** scrape websites, access private Discord servers without authorization, or bypass platform permissions.

---

## Data Sharing

Pokémon Restock Monitor does **not** share data with:

- Third-party analytics providers
- Advertising networks
- External services beyond Discord and Reddit APIs
- Other subreddits or app installations

All data usage is local to the subreddit where the app is installed.

---

## Security

The app uses Reddit’s managed infrastructure and permission system. Discord bot tokens and subreddit settings are handled through Reddit’s configuration mechanisms and are not exposed publicly.

Reasonable safeguards are used to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of configuration data.

---

## Children’s Privacy

Pokémon Restock Monitor is not directed toward children and does not knowingly collect any personal information from users of any age.

---

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or platform requirements. Material changes will be documented in the app’s repository or listing.

---

## Contact

If you have questions, concerns, or requests related to privacy or data handling, please contact the app maintainer via Reddit.

---

Pokémon Restock Monitor is provided as-is and operates only within subreddits where it has been explicitly installed and configured by moderators.
